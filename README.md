# Phantom-Run

## Description
Phantom-Run is a multi-level game where the objective is to complete each level as quickly as possible. What makes this game unique is that every level contains a puzzle that can be solved in a single attempt. However, the optimal way to solve it involves using a **"Ghost Run"**â€”a ghost version of the player from a previous attempt that can take on some of the tasks instead of the player.

In essence, the player controls two characters simultaneously and must figure out how to divide tasks between them to complete the level more efficiently.

### How It Works
For example, imagine a level where there is a button on the left side and the finish point on the right side. The button must be pressed to open the path to the finish line.

- **First Attempt:** The player moves left, presses the button, then heads to the finish.
- **Second Attempt:** The ghost from the first attempt presses the button, allowing the player to go directly to the finish line, minimizing the completion time.

- **Platform** (various types of moving/static platforms)
- **Splines** (path-following mechanics for objects)

### Level Design
- Levels are created using the **Cube Grid tool** in **Modeling Mode**.

### Save System
There are **three save classes**:
1. **Best Time Save:** Records the fastest time for a level.
2. **Ghost Data Save:** Stores player movements to replay them as a ghost.
3. **Game Progress Save:** Stores the player's current level for save/load functionality.

### Game Mode Functions
The game mode class defines **five core functions**:
- **Save Function** (stores game state)
- **Load Function** (retrieves game state)
- **Record Function** (logs player movements for ghost playback)
- **Replay Function** (executes ghost movement from a previous run)
- **Ghost Spawn Function** (creates the ghost entity based on saved data)
